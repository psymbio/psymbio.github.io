    <h1>Fastbook Lesson 3</h1>
    <br> <h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>

<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">1. Does ethics provide a list of "right answers"?</p><p>No. Ethics is dealing with good and bad; a set of moral principles. It deals with what questions to ask and how to weigh each decision. Ethics provides us with different perspectives of the problem and solution, whether it's utilitarian or hedonistic or consquential and then it depends on the situation and the principles you hold. Ethics are just a well-founded standard of what is outght to be done, there's no fixed set of rules and it's not the same as religion, law or social norms.</p></div>
<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">2. How can working with people of different backgrounds help when considering ethical questions?</p><p>Cultural relativism needs to be considered while answering ethical questions, because diversity and differences factor down to the decisions we take. For exapmle in some cultures it's considered auspicious to kill someone before they reach the age of 50, or like in Indian cultures where Sati was practiced out of duty. Placing objectivist views over such practices and ideas doesn't completely portray them.</p></div>
<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">3. What was the role of IBM in Nazi Germany? Why did the company participate as it did? Why did the workers participate?</p><p>IBM supplied the Nazis with machines to facilitate the holocaust. These were used to store the information of a person, whether they were Jewish or not, how they were killed in concentration camps. These machines required a lot of maintenance and an ongoing relationship with vendors, which IBM provided. There's another aspect to the story when we get to know why only IBM was selected for this task. It was bacause of the religious affiliations of IBM and it had declared itself German and free from foreign influences. By 1935, the profits coming in were so much that it became impossible not to report them.  It indeed appears that no one at IBM in the United States really knew what was going on at Dehomag, and there is no smoking gun anywhere for Watson’s or any American’s witting involvement in Nazi crimes. To the blind technocrat, the means were more important than the ends. The destruction of the Jewish people became even less important because the invigorating nature of IBM’s technical achievement was only heightened by the fantastical profits to be made at a time when bread lines stretched across the world. We must keep in mind: "Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral." The fruits of human inventiveness—whether punch-card machines, miracle drugs, atom bombs, or plowshares—contain no morality whatever in themselves, but how they are used is absolutely always a moral matter.</p></div>
<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">4. What was the role of the first person jailed in the Volkswagen diesel scandal?</p><p>James Liang was jailed and he was just following orders.</p></div>
<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">5. What was the problem with a database of suspected gang members maintained by California law enforcement officials?</p><p>It had 42 babies below the age of 1 registered as gang members and about 28 of them had admitted on being gang members. This databse was rarely updated only appended and it remains a question of how many of those entries were actually correct.</p></div>
<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">6. Why did YouTube's recommendation algorithm recommend videos of partially clothed children to pedophiles, even though no employee at Google had programmed this feature?</p><p></p></div>
<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">7. What are the problems with the centrality of metrics?</p><p>Centrality in the metrics often leads to gaming, which means that for example certain YouTube channels can realise the techniques and secrets to show up higher on a search result by using means like fake likes, views and followers etc. There could be a myopic focus on short term goals, like take the concept of Buzzfeed articles. It doesn't matter is the user just clicked because of the title the content no longer has to live up to the hype. There could be widespread manipulation, like how on social media political parties could then spread falsehoods about their opponents, ginning up panics about minority groups, and undermining people’s trust in the independent media. It could also lead to unexpected negative consquences. Much of AI/ML are centered around optimizing a metric and that's where this becomes a boon and a bane.</p></div>
<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">8. Why did Meetup.com not include gender in its recommendation system for tech meetups?</p><p></p></div>
<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">9. What are the six types of bias in machine learning, according to Suresh and Guttag?</p><p></p></div>
<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">10. Give two examples of historical race bias in the US.</p>The recidivism algorithm used for prison sentencing, it decides who has to pay bails and in the US not many can afford bail, sentencing, and parole decisions. It was found in case study that the false positive rates for black defendents was found twice as high than for white ones.<br /><br />An all-white jury was 16% more likely to convict a Black defendant than a white one, but when a jury had at least one Black member, it convicted both at the same rate.<br /><br />When whites and blacks were sent to bargain for a used car, blacks were offered initial prices roughly $700 higher, and they received far smaller concessions.<br /><br />Several studies found that sending emails with stereotypically black names in response to apartment-rental ads on Craigslist elicited fewer responses than sending ones with white names. A regularly repeated study by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development sent African-Americans and whites to look at apartments and found that African-Americans were shown fewer apartments to rent and houses for sale.<br /><br />White state legislators were found to be less likely to respond to constituents with African-American names. This was true of legislators in both political parties.<br /><br />When iPods were auctioned on eBay, researchers randomly varied the skin color on the hand holding the iPod. A white hand holding the iPod received 21 percent more offers than a black hand.<br /><br />Emails sent to faculty members at universities, asking to talk about research opportunities, were more likely to get a reply if a stereotypically white name was used.<p></p></div>
<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">11. Where are most images in ImageNet from?</p><p>Two-thirds of the images in ImageNet are from the US and other western countries that is why it performs significantly worse on data that doesn't come from the same region.</p></div>
<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">12. In the paper "Does Machine Learning Automate Moral Hazard and Error" why is sinusitis found to be predictive of a stroke?</p><p>This is a classic example of a measurement bias. Predictors of stroke were mesured as: Prior stroke, Prior accidental injury, abnormal breat feeding, cardiovascular disease history, colon cancer screening and acture sinusitis. The first, second and fourth are fine. The other four predictors—accidental injury, benign breast lump, colonoscopy, and sinusitis—are somewhat more mysterious. Could we have discovered novel biomedical risk factors for stroke?<br /><br />These measures are far removed from the prediction of a stroke. Here we see the presence of a billing code and notes recorded by a doctor. Moreover, unless the stroke is discovered during the ED visit, the patient must have either decided to return, or mentioned new symptoms to her doctors during hospital admission that provoked new testing. In other words, measured stroke is (at least) the compound of: having stroke-like symptoms, deciding to seek medical care, and being tested and diagnosed by a doctor. Medical data are as much behavioral as biological; whether a person decides to seek care can be as pivotal as actual stroke in determining whether they are diagnosed with stroke. Many decisions and judgments intervene in the assignment of a diagnosis code—or indeed, any piece of medical data, including obtaining and interpreting test results, admission and re-admission of a patient to the hospital, etc. Here we predicting both <span data-tooltip="The description of the use of services by persons for the purpose of preventing and curing health problems, promoting maintenance of health and well-being, or obtaining information about one's health status and prognosis." data-tooltip-position="bottom"><i>heavy utilization in healthcare</i></span> as well as a stroke. The problem is we haven't measured stroke separately, what we have measured is the symptoms, tests, and the diagnosis of strokes. This seems like a reasonable proxy for a stroke but a proxy is not wanted when you want to exactly know which disease it is. It's because these proxies can often determine any medical condition.</p></div>
<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">13. What is representation bias?</p><p></p></div>
<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">14. How are machines and people different, in terms of their use for making decisions?</p>Machine are different from people as:<ul><li>People assume they are objective and error-free.</li><li>Algorithms are more likely to be implemented with a no apeals system in place.</li><li>They are used at scale(they may be replicating bias at scale) and are cheaper.</li><li>ML can create feedback loops</li></ul><p></p></div>
<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">15. Is disinformation the same as "fake news"?</p><p>Fake news refers to those news stories that are false: the story itself is fabricated, with no verifiable facts, sources or quotes. Disinformation is when that false story is fabricated to cause harm to a person or a groups of people and is used to influence public opinion and obscure the truth. Whereas misinformation is false or inaccurate information that is mistakenly or inadvertently created or spread; the intent is not to deceive.</p></div>
<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">16. Why is disinformation through auto-generated text a particularly significant issue?</p><p></p></div>
<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">17. What are the five ethical lenses described by the Markkula Center?</p><p></p></div>
<div class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">18. Where is policy an appropriate tool for addressing data ethics issues?</p><p></p></div>
<div class="admonition tubelight"><p class="admonition-title">Biases</p><p>Often the biases in such systems come from real-world biases, but these systems have the power to amplify them and make them even worse.</p></div>

<h2 id="further-research">Further Research</h2>

<div class="admonition hint"><p class="admonition-title">1. Read the article "What Happens When an Algorithm Cuts Your Healthcare". How could problems like this be avoided in the future?</p><p>Article <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17144260/healthcare-medicaid-algorithm-arkansas-cerebral-palsy">link</a>. At the heart of any such problem is transparency, poeple who are directly affected by the results of some algorithms need to know what biases they hold and how it is being calculated. The state can't institute new policies without informing its citizens about all the reformations taking place. This particular scenario wasn't just about certain groups of people trying to exploit a system but it was about their lives being at stake, and the right to such information must be granted. Furthermore, you must understand even if the average citizen was given access to the code, they might not understand it or the results it produces, this means the system requires a human circuit breaker an intermediator between the complexity of algorithms and needs of the humans. The people of Arkansas complain that the previous system was rational and this one wasn't, and that was primarily because they could talk to, explain their needs and even grasp the previous system. The model needs to be tested under human supervision, as quite later on it was seen that based on the inputs of two patients in a similar condition the outputs had varied by a lot. Errors in the system need to be debugged and it can only happen when such systems are piloted and compared with output from the previous system in place. Place systems of recourse and accountability. Another article <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2018/08/07/hbr-bias-algorithms/">link</a>. We must also understand how to make better decisions, these are decisions that are less biased by leveraging the strengths of humans and machines working together.</p></div>
<div class="admonition hint"><p class="admonition-title">2. Research to find out more about YouTube's recommendation system and its societal impacts. Do you think recommendation systems must always have feedback loops with negative results? What approaches could Google take to avoid them? What about the government?</p><p>Feedback loops is when your model controls the next round of data you get, this way the returned data is quickly flawed by the software itself. Feedback loops in predictive policing could have negative impacts as starts to predict that more police should be sent where there is more crime, and so the next day there might be even more arrests in the same area, and this sort of incremental learning is then not predicting future crime but instead predicting future arrests. This then results in the bias being exploded over time. The only solution to this would be adding human circuit breakers in place to keep monitoring for such instances. Another example is Youtube which continously recommends similar videos and these can tend to be videos of very damaging conspiracy theories to pedophilic content.</p></div>
<div class="admonition hint"><p class="admonition-title">3. Read the paper "Discrimination in Online Ad Delivery". Do you think Google should be considered responsible for what happened to Dr. Sweeney? What would be an appropriate response?</p><p>Paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.6822.pdf">link</a>.</p></div>
<div class="admonition hint"><p class="admonition-title">4. How can a cross-disciplinary team help avoid negative consequences?</p><p></p></div>
<div class="admonition hint"><p class="admonition-title">5. Read the paper "Does Machine Learning Automate Moral Hazard and Error". What actions do you think should be taken to deal with the issues identified in this paper?</p><p></p></div>
<div class="admonition hint"><p class="admonition-title">6. Read the article "How Will We Prevent AI-Based Forgery?" Do you think Etzioni's proposed approach could work? Why?</p><p></p></div>
<div class="admonition hint"><p class="admonition-title">7. Complete the section "Analyze a Project You Are Working On" in this chapter.</p><p></p></div>
<div class="admonition hint"><p class="admonition-title">8. Consider whether your team could be more diverse. If so, what approaches might help?</p><p></p></div>

        <h1>The Catcher in the Rye
</h1>
        <section class="content">
            <p>It’s not the greatest coming-of-age book, that I can agree with. My only question is do coming-of-age books need to be great? If you ask me then they are the transitory phase between coloring books and actual greatness.</p>

<p>Getting into the nitty-gritty, I got slightly depressed reading it. Only slightly because it seemed like the book kind of just exploded by the end. Good start, funny, slightly witty like the protagonist and I’m fine with how it doesn’t aim to be something more or you know phony. I think as you sort of go through all these pages the book gets drunker<sup><a href="#drunk">[1]</a></sup> and shows you an ugly side of the cynicism presented. To me, it was like being shown what an all-time low in life looks like when a 17-year-old could conjure up a life with his mute wife and a job at a petrol pump. The thing is the book has to have got you to agree with how life is right now is pretty shit too, like Catholics stick together(birds of a feather flock together) or talking about the mileage in cars(showing-off) and buying and selling cars(that desire to always keep hustling). But a resolution to that sort of life isn’t running away from education, working at a petrol pump or being completely done with all forms of “stupid useless conversations”.</p>

<p>I like how the resolution is presented by a little boy singing, “If a body catch a body coming through the rye” and the antagonist of the story Mr. Antolini.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Something else an academic education will do for you. If you go along with it any considerable distance, it’ll begin to give you an idea what size mind you have. What it’ll fit and, maybe, what it won’t. After a while, you’ll have an idea what kind of thoughts your particular size mind should be wearing. For one thing, it may save you an extraordinary amount of time trying on ideas that don’t suit you, aren’t becoming to you. You’ll begin to know your true measurements and dress your mind accordingly.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For this review, I don’t have a concrete review on the plot of the book or the characters in it, partly because they weren’t great but also because the book wasn’t supposed to dwell on these characters or plotlines to create the ambiance of a world reigned by angst. Holden hates everything and so should you.</p>

<h2 id="addressing-criticism">Addressing criticism</h2>

<p>A relevant 1 star Google review by Ethan Carson:</p>

<div class="google-review">
First off, literally more than half the book is filler. The plot is extremely loose and underdeveloped, and just about nothing that happens plays on later. It's so excruciatingly boring, and it's like it's written to be that way. On almost every page, the protagonist starts talking about someone he met in the past. It adds nothing to the plot, for example, the protagonist will just randomly start talking about how he used to know a guy who could whistle really well for like 3 paragraphs or so, it's just so uninteresting and uninspired. I don't know how J.D. Salinger managed to keep himself entertained writing this. No one cares about the specifics of what he ate for breakfast or something either, I don't know why it puts so much focus on details that don't matter.

Secondly, it's not even well written, there are no sensory details or good flow to the sentences. Usually, the same word will be repeated so many times so close to each other, it's hard to read. Just as an example, on page 125, the word 'Catholic' is used eight times within six sentences. This happens a lot more often with people's names, because the book just avoids using pronouns for some reason, and it's super annoying.
</div>

<p>There’s something very specific to the book. The author tries to place you in the mind of the protagonist, experience the world with whatever experience he has. And to really accentuate this he introduces you to the lingo of this character. Each word of this “lingo” takes a different meaning as it is presented in each anecdote to be used in the present. It’s sort of as if the story behind the lingo isn’t as important as the word giving meaning to itself through it. In fact, this word is so prominent throughout the anecdote that at only one page of the book you’ll see it repeated several times to just disappear by the next.</p>

<p>The very first example of this is perhaps Mr. Spencer getting a big bang out of buying a Navajo blanket. Here the word becomes “big bang” explained by the anecdote of him buying the blanket and other stuff old people might get a big bang out of. And then he can use it in the present.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I don’t know his name, but he always plays the part of a guy in a war movie that gets yellow before it’s time to go over the top. He was with some gorgeous blonde, and the two of them were trying to be very blasé and all, like as if he didn’t even know people were looking at him.
Modest as hell. I got a <strong>big bang</strong> out of it.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn’t just happen with one word, there are many scattered around the book: Catholics, corny, bore, depressed, bourgeois, digression, and kill. My favorites are digression and kill.</p>

<h2 id="that-killed-me">That killed me.</h2>

<p>Kill is always presented to us in a negative connotation. In a way, “kill” in this book is the modern-day cringe.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>He said the play itself was no masterpiece, but that the Lunts, of course, were absolute angels. Angels. For Chrissake. Angels. <strong>That killed me.</strong> Then he and old Sally started talking about a lot of people they both knew. It was the phoniest conversation you ever heard in your life. They both kept thinking of places as fast as they could, then they’d think of somebody that lived there and mention their name. I was all set to puke when it was time to go sit down again.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think this word of his lingo is given a story before its usage. And that is exactly what interests me. When the word is given a story it is a completely different take on the word.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Old Phoebe’s clothes were on this chair right next to the
bed. She’s very neat, for a child. I mean she doesn’t just throw her stuff around, like some
kids. She’s no slob. She had the jacket to this tan suit my mother bought her in Canada
hung up on the back of the chair. Then her blouse and stuff were on the seat. Her shoes
and socks were on the floor, right underneath the chair, right next to each other. I never
saw the shoes before. They were new. They were these dark brown loafers, sort of like
this pair I have, and they went swell with that suit my mother bought her in Canada. My
mother dresses her nice. She really does. My mother has terrific taste in some things.
She’s no good at buying ice skates or anything like that, but clothes, she’s perfect. I mean Phoebe always has some dress on that can <strong>kill you</strong>. You take most little kids, even if their
parents are wealthy and all, they usually have some terrible dress on. I wish you could see
old Phoebe in that suit my mother bought her in Canada. I’m not kidding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of the kills that follow this one are much softer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PHOEBE WEATHERFIELD CAULFIELD<br />
4B-1<br /><br /><em>That killed me. Her middle name is Josephine, for God’s sake, not Weatherfield.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Kid’s notebooks kill me.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it returns to it’s usual meaning when Phoebe uses it in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Daddy’ll kill you!”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="digression">Digression!</h2>

<p>Yes, the story digresses from the actual plot but Salinger attempts to somewhat salvage himself from that kind of criticism. I think it’s about the second last chapter Holden talking about his English teacher Mr. Vinson and the oral examination he failed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The trouble with me is, I like it when somebody digresses. It’s more interesting and all.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I quite agree with him, a book being called, “The Catcher in the Rye” and that sort of is titled for everything it’s not. This is the one time the book is giving meaning to word, not in the protagonist’s lingo but someone else’s and takes the lingo to then explain the concept of the book. And it is quite riveting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Holden. . . One short, faintly stuffy, pedagogical question. Don’t you think there’s a time and place for everything? Don’t you think if someone starts out to tell you about his father’s farm, he should stick to his guns, then get around to telling you about his uncle’s brace? Or, if his uncle’s brace is such a provocative subject, shouldn’t he have selected it in the first place as his subject–not the farm?”<br /><br />“Yes–I don’t know. I guess he should. I mean I guess he should’ve picked his uncle as a subject, instead of the farm, if that interested him most. But what I mean is, lots of time you don’t know what interests you most till you start talking about something that doesn’t interest you most. I mean you can’t help it sometimes. What I think is, you’re supposed to leave somebody alone if he’s at least being interesting and he’s getting all excited about something. I like it when somebody gets excited about something. It’s nice. You just didn’t know this teacher, Mr. Vinson. He could drive you crazy sometimes, him and the goddam class. I mean he’d keep telling you to unify and simplify all the time. Some things you just can’t do that to. I mean you can’t hardly ever simplify and unify something just because somebody wants you to. You didn’t know this guy, Mr. Vinson. I mean he was very intelligent and all, but you could tell he didn’t have too much brains.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know it’s not much of an explanation but it shall suffice for why the book meanders. I really do wish Ethan Carson could read this.</p>

<h2 id="caulfield">Caulfield</h2>

<p>The other part I like about it is resonating with Caulfield:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hating things and liking even fewer. The kind of hate he presents you with is different, you might hate something but still miss the absence of it. It’s the kind of hate that I’ve known all my life: to sit at tables and really be vocal about the certain oddities you find in people sitting in front of you that just tears you up. It’s not like you’d wish for them to disappear(for they fuel that train of thought) but it’s something about that specific kind of hate that just never wants to die out. I sincerely think, the day that this kind of hate dies out in me I’ll be dead or depressed.</li>
  <li>There was never a chance where I thought he was a shitty character. Most people would call him whiny, immature and all that crap but all of this felt more real of him to be (at least for his age). The way he cherishes the presence of kids more to adults of his own age shows you that maybe he was better off not knowing about the inner-workings of this big bad world.</li>
  <li>I love the duck question he keeps asking, it reminded of an episode in The Sopranos.</li>
</ul>

<p>I like this character summary from the New Yorker:</p>

<div class="new-yorker">
Holden is not a normal boy. He is hypersensitive and hyper-imaginative (perhaps these are synonymous). He is double-minded. He is inexorably self-critical; at various times, he refers to himself as yellow, as a terrible liar, a madman, a moron. He is driven crazy by “phoniness,” a heading under which he loosely lumps not only insincerity but snobbery, injustice, callousness to the tears in things, and a lot more. He is a prodigious worrier. (“When I really worry about something, I don’t just fool around. I even have to go to the bathroom when I worry about something. Only, I don’t go. I’m too worried to go.”) He is moved to pity unconscionably often. He has few defenses. For example, he is driven frantic by a scrawled obscenity some vandal has chalked on the wall of his ten-year-old sister Phoebe’s school. Grown men sometimes find the emblazoned obscenities of life too much for them, and leave this world indecorously, so the fact that a sixteen-year-old boy is overwhelmed should not be surprising. When another boy steals his gloves, Holden can’t just go up to the boy’s room, accuse him of stealing his gloves, and hit him in the jaw. He is scared by what he imagines the culprit’s face will look like while his jaw is being demolished. (“I can’t stand looking at the other guy’s face, is my trouble. It wouldn’t be so bad if you could both be blindfolded or something.”) He is also worried by the lack of an acute sense of ownership; he didn’t really care about losing the gloves in the first place.
</div>

<h2 id="the-controversy">The Controversy</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Up home we wear a hat like that to shoot deer in, for Chrissake,” he said. “That’s a deer shooting hat.” . . . “Like hell it is.” I took it off and looked at it. I sort of closed one eye, like I was taking aim at it. “This is a people shooting hat,” I said. “I shoot people in this hat.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Holden’s comment declaring that it’s “a people shooting hat” reveals feelings of hostility toward a society that, in his eyes, continuously reminds him that he doesn’t quite fit in. While Holden’s tendency to make such off-color remarks reveals his on-going desire to stand out as an individual, such comments might also serve a second purpose: They allow Holden to isolate himself from others, which provides protection from the uncomfortable feeling of always feeling like an outsider.</p>

<p>About three shootings are on the account of this book. The most famous of which is the shooting of John Lennon by Mark David Chapman.</p>

<p>I recommend watching it because the Salinger documentary seemed “phony” and this on the other hand really shows you the consequences of the book. Also I’d love to know what you think about my interpretation of the book.</p>

<p id="drunk">
[1] The Catcher in the Rye struggles with the dark thought that maybe everything is fake and meaningless. Most authors would consider such a psychological premise like that for a short story, but Salinger stretches it out over 200 pages, diving deeper and deeper into Holden’s spiritual downward spiral

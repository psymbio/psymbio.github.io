A personal blog, still underway.

This blog is inspired from [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/) and [PoetryFoundation](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/), I just really like the minalmalism and the fact that these sites use just three colors and look great.

It's sort of a put together using inspirations from [Monica Dinculescu's site](https://meowni.ca/) and a [Wordpress theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyone/).

Then after a while my site just ended up looking like an exact copy of <www.mit.edu>, so might as well pick the font they use.

If you want a blog like this just: 
+ Step 1: Clone my repository to your local machine.
+ Step 2: Install Jekyll: Follow the installation process for your OS from <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/>.
+ Step 3: Making changes to the cloned repository: Since your working with my blog, you need to make changes in a couple of the files to make it unique to you. You could start by changing the colors, fonts, etc. in the .css files. Then change stuff like the posts in the `_posts folder`, by adding your own posts. All of this is written in markdown, which is easier to manage in the long run. Change the logo in the in layout.html file. I’d recommend making your own logo on canva.com. Change minor stuff like the title, headings in the files. Delete the .git folder.
+ Step 4: Initialize your own repo and hosting the website: On your GitHub account initialize a repo called ‘your-username’.github.io. Then just follow the steps shown on the new repo to host the files on GitHub.
+ Step 5: Done:) You can always change things around by changing a few variables.

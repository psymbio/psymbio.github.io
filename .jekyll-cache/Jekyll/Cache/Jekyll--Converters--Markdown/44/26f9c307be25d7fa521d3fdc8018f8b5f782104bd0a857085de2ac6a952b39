<p class="admonition-title">3. What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron?</p>
<p>The first artificial neuron based device was the Mark 1 Perceptron by Frank Rosenblatt.  This machine was designed for image recognition: it had an array of 400 photocells, randomly connected to the "neurons". Weights were encoded in potentiometers, and weight updates during learning were performed by electric motors.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">5. What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks?</p>
<p>Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert published a book called "Perceptrons", in which they wrote that single layer of such devices was unable to encode simple mathematicla functions like XOR but multiple layers could solve the problem. Only the latter part of this insight was recognized.<br /><br />
Another misunderstanding was that the second layer as proposed by Minsky could solve the problem of mathematical models in neural networks but often was to slow and big to be useful in the industry. What they didn't know is to get pratical good performance you need to use even more layers(make them more deep).

<p>GPU or graphics processing unit was originally designed to accelerate the rendering of 3D graphics. And over time their capabilities were used to perform high performance computing(HPC), deep learning etc. Because GPUs incorporate an extraordinary amount of computational capability, they can deliver incredible acceleration in workloads that take advantage of the highly parallel nature of GPUs, such as image recognition. Many of today‚Äôs deep learning technologies rely on GPUs working in conjunction with CPUs.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">14. Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?</p>
<p>This is a highly-researched topic known as interpretability of deep learning models. Deep learning models are hard to understand in part due to their ‚Äúdeep‚Äù nature. Think of a linear regression model. Simply, we have some input variables/data that are multiplied by some weights, giving us an output. We can understand which variables are more important and which are less important based on their weights. A similar logic might apply for a small neural network with 1-3 layers. However, deep neural networks have hundreds, if not thousands, of layers. It is hard to determine which factors are important in determining the final output. The neurons in the network interact with each other, with the outputs of some neurons feeding into other neurons. Altogether, due to the complex nature of deep learning models, it is very difficult to understand why a neural network makes a given prediction.<br /><br />However, in some cases, recent research has made it easier to better understand a neural network‚Äôs prediction. For example, as shown in this chapter, we can analyze the sets of weights and determine what kind of features activate the neurons. When applying CNNs to images, we can also see which parts of the images highly activate the model. We will see how we can make our models interpretable later in the book.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">15. What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy?</p>
<p></p>
</div>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">16. What do you need in order to train a model?</p>
<p>To train a model you need data. It needs patterns to operate on the data. We need not only examples of input data but also labels of that data.</p>
</div>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">17. How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model?</p>
<p>Feedback loops would help in predicting the arrests, give information on where to increase policing, then again the feedback from these arrests would go back into the model to re-train it. In this positive feedback loop the more biased the data becomes the more biased is the model.</p>
</div>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">18. Do we always have to use 224√ó224-pixel images with the cat recognition model?</p>
<p>It's not necessary to use 224x224 pixel images, however you can make sure that all the images in the dataset are of the same size, smaller than the real images, and usually black and white. This would save a lot on the compue time and space however if these aren't followed as such you can get better results in the model on the cost of compute time and space.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">19. What is the difference between classification and regression?</p>
<p>Classification is usually applied to specify the classes that specific data can belong to whereas regression is used to generate a number. Where classification produces mostly discreet results, where regression gives a continuous result.</p>
</div>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">20. What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them?</p>
<p>Validation sets help in checking whether or not the model is overfitted. But even then it doesn't ensure the intergrity of the model. To make sure for certain set aside a portion of your dataset as the test set and not let the model see at all, use this to check the performance.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">23. What is overfitting? Provide an example.
</p>
<p>Overfitting happens when you train your model for too long with not enough data.<img alt="" src="/images/2021/fastai/overfit.png" height="80%" width="80%" />You end up having a function that's too closely fit over a limited set of data points.</p>

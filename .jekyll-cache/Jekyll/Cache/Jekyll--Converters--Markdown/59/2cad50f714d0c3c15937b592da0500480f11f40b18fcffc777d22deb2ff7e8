<p>Well, I was sort of ignorant to what philosophy even really was. Prior to this, it was mostly Freud’s bullshit or some of Plato’s Republic. So, this is one of those courses that gets your feet wet to all the big questions of philosophy. Whether it be general dinner party conversations or the study of the mind, philosophy plays a role.</p>

<p>I actually came across this podcast by BrainInspired.co with Ida Mommenejad and she is a philosophy major that has done a lot of research in the brain and really that’s the point I was really sold to the point that philosophy matters. After all, it is well-formed arguments that the mind needs to agree with and conform to. If we were truly looking at creating a brain then it would also raise philosophical arguments and we would need to find solutions to them. If these robots were to take any actions, they may have to evaluate every reason for it and whether it complies with whatever morality structure they’ve been built on.</p>

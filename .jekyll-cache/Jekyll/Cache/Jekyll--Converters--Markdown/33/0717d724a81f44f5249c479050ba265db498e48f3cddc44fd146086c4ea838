I"Á<p>This year as a joke I decided to try out building Hellâ€™s Kitchen OS. And no Iâ€™m not obsessed with Gordon Ramsay, but the OS needed to be a prank that was better than a RickRoll.</p>

<p>As resources for the project, we donâ€™t have a lot of clean data. We need to collect all the bits and pieces in parts. The only legit sources I know of are: <a href="ops-class.org">ops-class.org</a> the class Zuckerberg struggled in, and Terry O. Davisâ€™s 830 GiB Torrent files, which from what Iâ€™ve heard itâ€™s mostly filled with (profanity alert) videos of him fapping and n-words.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s an inspiring quote from the man: â€œI wrote a compiler, nigger. I am smarter than Linus. I wrote a kernel
and compiler.â€</p>

<p>When you decide the theme for your OS, youâ€™re flying in the air thinking itâ€™s all going to be possible, almost too easy. Iâ€™ll just change my desktop picture. Youâ€™re wrong.</p>

<p>Most OSs are quite boring and just need to have the basic functionality. If you look at Windows 10, from a Linux perspective, youâ€™ve sort of learnt how to be minimal with the softwares you use on a daily basis. And really, 90% of Windows is just basically bloat. All you really need in an OS is a file management system, a universal text editor that can handle almost any file, maybe a tux paint, something for viewing images and videos and a browser (networking capabilities).</p>

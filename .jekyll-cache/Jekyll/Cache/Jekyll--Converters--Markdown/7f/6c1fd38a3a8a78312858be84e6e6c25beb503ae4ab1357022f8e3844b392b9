<p>We might lose data while converting the signals of EEG from the time to frequency domain. That’s a short-coming of static spectral analyses, and so to be able to extract frequency specific information over time we use wavelet convolution.</p>

<p>What’s a wavelet?</p>

<div class="wikipedia">
A wavelet is a wave-like oscillation with an amplitude that begins at zero, increases or decreases, and then returns to zero one or more times. Wavelets are termed a "brief oscillation". A taxonomy of wavelets has been established, based on the number and direction of its pulses. Wavelets are imbued with specific properties that make them useful for signal processing.

<p>かわいいですね💮</p>

<p>Requirements for a wavelet: it integrates to zero or the sum total is zero over time and it tapers to zero in the beginning and the end.</p>

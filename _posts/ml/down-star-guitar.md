Life update: Summer's going to finally start and I've scored three internships in the exact same field. Machine Learning: The All Great & Mighty. I kinda feel a little bad that it's this and not some kernel programming but you know what, I don't feel that bad, even about how generic it is to be doing ML.

Internship 1: Work at a lab and learn the fundamentals of ML, neural networks, GANs and finally apply them to EEG.

Internship 2: Work for a UK company that needs to analyze their EEG data to cure dementia with gaming. That's kinda noble, I do hope it works though.

Internship 3: Some random ML thing, where they teach you ML and ask you to make projects.

Now let me introduce you to: Star Guitar, a DIY project to carry out in the summer of 2021.

(Introductory rant - that has mostly nothing to do with anything)
Recently in an interview for a club, I was asked how do we motivate kids to code. And that's a weird-ass question, but to me it's sort of like well-you-can't really force it into anyone right? This basically means there's two sets of degenerates in college: ones that steal code (well even stealing is an art) and ones that don't give two fucks. I really am fed up with like both the categories but you know it's life, you gotta cope. So how do you make these people code. Well for starters please give them projects they can't find online (that's for the scums) but then I guess for me motivating people to code really comes to seeing the output, before even sitting to do whatever. It's sort of like change the dataset so you get people to do the work. This way they can fathom the output of whatever. So, to motivate you right now, I urge you to scroll down see what the output looks like and then maybe get the motivation to work out something for yourself (you scum, just kidding).

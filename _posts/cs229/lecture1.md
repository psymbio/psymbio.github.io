Arthur Samuel checkers playing program: a program better than his creator.

Arthur Samuel (1958) Machine Learning: Give computers the ability to learn instead of being explicitly programmed.

Tom Mitchell (1998) Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Supervised Learning:

Regression: house pricing based on size and prices. How to get y from x when you already have a bunch of (x,y)s

Classification Problem: is the tumor malignant or not depending on the size of the tumor.

Logistic Regression Algorithm

Dean Pomerleau: self-driving cars

Back propogation

Gradient Descent

ML strategy: choose the correct algorithm

Unsupervised learning

K-means clusterng

Astronomical data, social network analysis, organizing computing clusters, market segmentation

Algorithm to separate the voices: Cocktail party problem, ICA: Independent Components Analysis

RL: flying a helicopter

Requester,

We are happy to release our new version of the Moments in Time dataset
(MiT-2) with 305 classes.

The cached raw data can be downloaded from the following link (275 GB),
http://data.csail.mit.edu/soundnet/actions3/split2/Moments_in_Time_Raw_v2.zip.

We ask that anyone that uses the data, or pre-trained models, please
cite this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03150.

We have also updated our Multi-Moments in Time dataset (M-MiT-2) with
292 classes.

The cached data can be downloaded from the following link (341 GB),
http://data.csail.mit.edu/soundnet/actions3/split2/Multi_Moments_in_Time_v2.zip.

We ask that anyone that uses the data, or pre-trained models, please
cite this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00232.

For both MiT-2 and M-MiT-2, we provide a GitHub repository with
pre-trained models and example code for using the models, located here,
https://github.com/metalbubble/moments_models.  Updated results can also
be found in the repository.

The only differences between the original versions of the datasets and
this second version is a revision to the class vocabulary. Videos
without labels after the revision have been removed.

## Morlet Wavelets (Usage and Python Implementation)

We might lose data while converting the signals of EEG from the time to frequency domain. That's a short-coming of static spectral analyses, and so to be able to extract frequency specific information over time we use wavelet convolution.

What's a wavelet?

<div class="wikipedia">
A wavelet is a wave-like oscillation with an amplitude that begins at zero, increases or decreases, and then returns to zero one or more times. Wavelets are termed a "brief oscillation". A taxonomy of wavelets has been established, based on the number and direction of its pulses. Wavelets are imbued with specific properties that make them useful for signal processing.

Yeah, there's a bit of cheating, we can't graph complex numbers in desmos and I'll probably have to look into plotting these another way, but for now the only online substitute is visit [this](https://jutanium.github.io/ComplexNumberGrapher/) and type this: $$\cos (2\pi z)+z\sin (2\pi z)$$ z(from Euler's formula) and like all things complex, you must imagine yourself multiplying it with a gaussian and creating a morlet.

Euler's formula for the basic waves $$e^{2\pi i \theta}$$ is $$e^{2\pi i \theta} = cos(2\pi\theta) + i sin(2\pi\theta)$$.

The Arctic Monkeys logo might be more mathematic than you think.

Requirements for a wavelet: it integrates to zero or the sum total is zero over time and it tapers to zero in the beginning and the end.

Wavelets provide temporal specificity when used as weighting functions for signals, as when these signals are convoluted(sliding dot product between the kernel and the section of signal it's aligned with) with the kernel(in this case the morlet wavelet).

This amplitude spectrum we gain after the fourier transform of the wavelet is symmetric, this isn't the case when we deal with a complex valued wavelet. Also in the plot above, the Hz units are incorrect above the Nyquist (for plotting convenience).

Tip: don't do time-domain convolutions as it can lead to errors, just use the fft function.

So like there's a nifty detail about this type of convolution.

This is just the same as doing this: <div class="mermaid" align="center" height="70%" width="70%">

    A["Signal"]-->|FFT| C("Fourier Transformed Signal")
    B["Kernel"]-->|FFT| D("Fourier Transformed Kernel")

    D-->|Multiply| E["Fourier Transformed Signal"]
    E-->|IFFT| F("Convoluted Signal *")</div></p>
    * means they are similar.
    The reason we prefer doing fast fourier transform over the normal convolution is because it's faster and less complicated/risky.
    Convolution in the time domain is multiplication in the frequency domain.

Convolution as a spectral filter (from the PSD of the signal and kernel we can see which frequencies shall be retained.)
